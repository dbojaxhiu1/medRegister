## System Requirements

In order to run the application we need an Android Emulator, which requires the following system requirements on the machine: Windows 7 or later (64-bit), macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher (64-bit), Linux GNOME or KDE Desktopp (64-bit). RAM Memory should be minimum 4GB and 8GB RAM is recommended to run the emulator.
 As a workaround a physical device can also be used to run the application without worrying about the RAM memory or the CPU.
 
## Installation and build

Clone this repository and import into **Android Studio**

Application can be ran from inside the Android Studio, all needed to do is to create an Emulator from Device Manager, and we will be able to load the application in Emulator. Another option is physical device which can be connected to run the app.
